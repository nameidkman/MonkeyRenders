# One of the main thing 
    Basically what happens is that you are going to have somehting like this 
    There is the X,Z,Y axis instead of the other one cuz that is the more basic axis which are used in this. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> i was able to make it so that it working in terminal i just need to update the thing to the newest one and then it will
    work Basically what i am doing is that 
    C:\Users\Saiansh\.jdks\openjdk-22.0.1\bin\java.exe  -jar .\3d.jar
    This is woring fine what i am doing in here is that i am running it with the same one as i have in the right thing
    It i need to make it working with the other one all i would need to is that i would have to build it with the right one
    And then it will work out
    As well as that i have made a runme.bat file which works on my system which is nice to work with so yea

I am going to add a way to add texture and other shapes like tmr or somthing depending on how it works work
which should be pretty sweet

other than that i am maybe doing to add a ywa in which they can move the block around if i really want to 
and yea making keybinding for whem they just want to move in the X, Y, Z axixs like yea
