# the basic premes for this is that its going to be able to render object in 3d space
basically its a 3d render it going to be making a 3d obejcts 

in order to move around in this all you would need to do is us "wasd" for moving left shift to go down and then space to go up 
if you would like to snap the camera and change the prespective you can aslo use the left ctrl in order to move your prespective easily 

if you would like to run the render you are going to run the runme.bat and then after that you are going to be greated with a cube 
if you would like to add some other shapes in there are well you can also do right click in order to make that happen 

after right click you are going to be greeated wiht another window using which you are able to justs add some other stuff as well like a 
pyrmaid and a sphere in there as well


for moving the obeject what you can do is that you can just left click on this and that will let you do that

for animation what you are going to do is that you can have a mvoe object around in the 3d shapes and then 
have have come back to their original posiiton this is going to hapen by pressing the "j"
